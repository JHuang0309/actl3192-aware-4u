            type: 'noun',
            definition: 'Indexation refers to the process of adjusting payments or benefits in line with inflation to maintain purchasing power over time.',
            example: `Imagine you receive $1,000 per month in superannuation payments. With inflation, prices rise over time, meaning that $1,000 wonâ€™t buy as much next year as it does today. Indexation adjusts your payment to keep up with these price increases. For example, if inflation is 3% over the year, your monthly payment would increase by 3% to $1,030, helping you maintain the same purchasing power.`
